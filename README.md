# serial connection between brains

Connect the brains together on port 1, and plug a cable with a motor into either brains port 20. This will be the receiver.
Connect a controller to the brain without the motor, and start the program.

# IMPORTANT
Press the **RECEIVE** button FIRST, on the Receiver brain.
Press the **SEND** button SECOND, on the Sender brain.

Move the left Y axis. The motor should follow.

Latency is a problem right now, higher baudrate might fix things but uncertain.
